This project outlines the implementation of Basic Authentication on a simple API using Python's Flask framework. It focuses on understanding and building the authentication process step-by-step, including setting up the server, handling unauthorized and forbidden errors, creating an `Auth` class, and developing a `BasicAuth` class to manage Base64 encoded credentials.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or system.
2. **Base64 Encoding**: A method of encoding binary data into ASCII characters, which is commonly used in HTTP headers.
3. **HTTP Headers**: Metadata exchanged between clients and servers in HTTP requests, like the `Authorization` header.

### Tasks Summary:
1. **Simple-basic-API**: Set up a basic API and verify its functionality using curl commands.
2. **Error Handlers**: Implement error handlers for 401 (Unauthorized) and 403 (Forbidden) HTTP status codes.
3. **Auth Class**: Develop an `Auth` class to handle basic authentication mechanisms, such as checking authorization headers.
4. **Define Routes**: Specify which API routes require authentication and which do not.
5. **Request Validation**: Implement logic to validate requests by checking for authorization headers and authenticating users.
6. **BasicAuth Class**: Create a `BasicAuth` class that extends the `Auth` class to handle Base64 encoding and decoding of credentials.
7. **Base64 Operations**: Implement methods to extract and decode the Base64 part of the `Authorization` header.
8. **User Credentials**: Extract and manage user credentials (email and password) from the Base64 decoded string.

### Practical Steps:
- **Set Up**: Install dependencies and start the Flask server.
- **Testing**: Use curl to test API endpoints and validate the correct implementation of authentication features.
- **Coding**: Write and test Python scripts to handle authentication and manage user data securely.

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to authentication in web applications, specifically focusing on understanding and implementing the Basic Authentication mechanism using Python and Flask.
